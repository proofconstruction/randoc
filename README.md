# Randoc
## A random document generator

Randoc is a Python library for generating random documents of several types:

- Legal documents
- Academic research papers
- Letters
- Advertisements
- ... and more!

Randoc requires Python 3.8 or higher, and additionally depends on `texlive` and `ghostscript` to generate PDFs, and `poppler-utils` for converting the resulting PDF to a PNG via `pdftoppm`.
